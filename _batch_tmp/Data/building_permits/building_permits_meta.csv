1,"The Building permits survey covers all Canadian municipalities that issue permits. The number of Canadian municipalities currently surveyed is approximately 2,400, representing all the provinces and territories. They account for 95% of the Canadian population. Historically, the data are not strictly comparable due to the continuing improvement in coverage and the modifications to the geographical areas required to reflect the most recent census definitions."
2,"The present value corresponds only to the value associated to the units created. This value can differ from the value reported under the appellation "residential" in historical tables, due to values associated to the renovation for example."
3,"Formerly Sudbury."
4,"Formerly Ottawa-Hull. Note: to obtain the total for Ottawa-Gatineau CMA, the Ontario part (35505) and Quebec part (24505) will have to be added together."
5,"Formerly Chicoutimi-Jonquière."
6,"Minor non-residential improvements projects refer to permits valued at less than $250,000."
7,"Seasonally adjusted data for the total number of housing units as well as for the aggregate value of building permits are obtained indirectly, for example, by adding their seasonally adjusted components. The total number of dwelling units is obtained by summing the seasonally adjusted data for single- and multiple-family units; the total value of building permits is obtained by summing the following elements: residential, industrial, commercial and institutional. Some series contain no apparent seasonality. In these cases, unadjusted values have been tabulated and aggregated to the adjusted values of the other series. At the end of the year, the chronological series adjusted for seasonality are revised to take into account the most recent seasonal fluctuations."
8,"Beginning in reference month January 2018, the methodology for cottages has changed. Previously, this type of structure was coded as "Single house" if the value of the permit was higher than $60,000. This transformation is no longer performed."
9,"For historical data see table 34100066."
10,"Data processing methodology has been updated as of January 2018. Comparisons between the previous data and the subsequent data should be used with caution."
11,"The sum may not add up to the total due to rounding."
12,"Data for the provincial totals can not be reconciled because data at the census agglomerations and census subdivision levels is not publish in this table."
13,"Detailed information for all types of work may not be available for all regions, as permit regulations and requirements vary by municipality."
14,"Monthly estimates for constant dollars are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0276-01).  The monthly indexes used for the deflation process were part of a methodology review to increase the quality of the constant dollar and seasonally adjusted series. They previously displayed a step pattern due to lower frequency collection."
